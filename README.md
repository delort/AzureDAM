# Digital Asset Management in Azure
This is the demo code from my presentation "Hyperscal Digital Asset Management in Azure" at TechDays Sweden October 22nd 2015. 

To run this demo you will need to setup the following: 

- Storage account for blob storage of images and queue for message bus messages
- DocumentDB database for asset metadata storage
- Azure Search with datasource connected to the DocumentDB and index (defined in the demosetup project)
- Media Serivces account 
- Optional CDN network account

Have fun.
